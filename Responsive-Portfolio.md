# Responsive-Portfolio

This is almost the same thing as the website used for Homework 1, except this one is responsive and will change according to the dimensions of the media being used. There are three stages to this. 

Stage 1
-------

This is going to be the stage of the desktop. It will essentially stay the same up until you bring the dimensions down to 980px. Once that is done, you will change the dimesntions of the thing at this one. 

Stage 2
-------

Tablets appear to be going out of style. To a degree. Once that happens, I wonder if itll be a good idea to have this one around anymore. Regarless of that fact, people styll use it and I have made a media query when the dimensions reach the specifications I've added to it. Neat. These will change once the dimesions reach 979px. Also neat.

Stage 3
-------

Perhaps the most important stage. Everyone lives inside their phone. It's frightening. ANYWAYS, this is the stage in which the website will change to fit within the dimensions of a phone. There are several different phone sizes which makes this sort of irritating, so I made sure that the design of the site will fit within the smallest screen to the largest one. I'm so happy that was the case.
